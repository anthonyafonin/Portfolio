            <h3>Fisherman</h3>
            <p>The last three Summers, I would travel to Bristol Bay, Alaska and net fish for red salmon for two months. Every fishing trip I would work for a different captain. <br>The fishing crew always consisted of two deckhands and the captain. <br>We would all live on the small 32 foot boat the entire fishing season.</p>

            <h3>Golfing</h3>
            <p>In high school, I was part of the Junior Varsity golf team. Golf is one of my favorite pastimes and my go-to sport. I have always been an average player but I'm constantly pushing myself to improve. Golfing is a great way to clear your mind and to get to know the people you play with.</p>

            <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
            <p>Another one of my favorite hobbies and pastimes is Snowboarding. <br>I started during Spring of 2017 so I'm still fairly new. Since I live in Oregon, <br>I'm able to snowboard down the resorts on Mt. Hood. Riding down the snow covered mountain is by far the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. </p>
